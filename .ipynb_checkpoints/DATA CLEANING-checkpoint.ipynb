Also, I joined  the result of the previoilusl 2 joins with my city zipcode (a datasset I created). This is a list of all the zip code within buffalo. The result of this join gave me all the districts in buffalo. Next I remove any duplicates and empty datasets that (usually due to lack of information). Afterwards, I create a list of schools in buffalo and their data using the .isin function and loc. Finally i attach ththe school with the district data.I usually output CSVs in order to look at it in excel. It helps me visualize the data map."
